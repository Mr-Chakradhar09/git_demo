We were trying to understand the impact of changing levels of discretization, um, on both our data.\n\n3\n\nJohn Doe 00:00:42.784 --> 00:01:03.454\n\nAnd the original data, um, and 1 of the main things we were trying to to figure it out is, uh, because we did not have access to the notebook, uh, that you ran the analysis with was to how can we reproduce some of the results and in doing so I think we found something sort of fairly critical, which, which it was.\n\n4\n\nJohn Doe 00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:24.694\n\nAnswered earlier this morning, but, um, it's sort of prohibited us from continuing any further analysis in the sense that it seems that the, uh, evaluation of the testing, uh, of the downstream classifier was somehow done on the training data. Um, and the problem is.\n\n5\n\nJohn Doe 00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:45.004\n\nThat if we, um, I mean, obviously, we will have to rectify that, because it's, it's not informative fee kind of, uh, you know, use the training data for testing. But, um, I mean, if if that were in the protocol, just switching the level of visualization of the method.\n\n6\n\nJohn Doe 00:01:46.774 --> 00:02:06.754\n\nUm, to 10 minutes, that was, I think the case in the original setup, uh, takes the to 95% and I think that's kind of what triggered us to understand that that cannot be happening. Um, so 1 of the objectives, uh, if, if the group agrees for today's meeting, I think maybe we could just set up a.\n\n7\n\nJohn Doe 00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:28.114\n\nUm, outline for a consistent evaluation protocol that we can replicate on our side as well. And then, um, we essentially can replicate, uh, reproduce the, the, you know, as long as we can ensure, we can review the numbers. Um, we could just repeat our.\n\n8\n\nJohn Doe 00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:37.204\n\nAnalysis and in the next meeting shared that does that does that sound good to do? Are there any questions 1st of all? I think maybe I should ask that.\n\n9\n\nJohn Doe 00:02:47.555 --> 00:03:06.215\n\nAwesome, no, no questions then in that case, does that sound good to maybe, uh, go through the notebook a little bit, uh, in detail this time to understand the evaluation protocol um, and then we have certain suggestions that, uh, we could make about.\n\n10\n\nJohn Doe 00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:17.884\n\nUm, how we, uh, currently evaluate, um, to just avoid, uh, information leakage from training into the test would that be okay?\n\n11\n\nJane Doe 00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:25.834\n\nAnd maybe a, just to summarize for everyone, it sounds like you ran you rebound the tests that they were doing.\n\n12\n\nJane Doe 00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:31.594\n\nThe team has already done and achieved, uh.\n\n13\n\nJane Doe 00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:46.924\n\nOur score point 95 or something, so quite high, but suggestions that that probably isn't the best marker to evaluate and so we want to go back through it and make some suggestions on the overall approach.\n\n14\n\nJohn Doe 00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:52.534\n\nThat's right. That's right. I think I think the only just to kind of get the, the idea of, like, what we change.\n\n15\n\nJohn Doe 00:03:52.774 --> 00:04:13.894\n\nIf we change the level of discretization of our model to the level of discretization that, uh, was in the notebook for the original data, and then follow the same testing training protocol, which I must say is not, uh, we do get 95% but primarily, because we are testing on training data.\n\n16\n\nJohn Doe 00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.154\n\nIs not the right thing to do?\n\n17\n\nJane Doe 00:04:18.604 --> 00:04:22.564\n\nYou train the data are using, uh, the the same target.\n\n18\n\nJohn Doe 00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:24.334\n\nYes.\n\n19\n\nJohn Doe 00:04:30.634 --> 00:04:47.734\n\nI mean, we just, we, we, we were just trying to replicate the results. So I think the my main concern is that the results that maybe we shared last time WH, what were shared with last time. They, we can't. Those are not right in some sense, right? The, the results were done by training and testing.\n\n20\n\nJohn Doe 00:04:47.764 --> 00:04:48.664\n\nOn the same dataset.\nSummary:\"\"\"\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Execution\nLet us now use the defined Model object and pair it with input and\ngenerate the response:\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "print(\"Submitting generation request...\")\ngenerated_response = model.generate_text(prompt=prompt_input, guardrails=True)\nprint(generated_response)\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Next steps\nYou successfully completed this notebook!
